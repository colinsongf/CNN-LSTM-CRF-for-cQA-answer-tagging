# CNN-LSTM-CRF-for-cQA-answer-tagging
Provide results for CNN+LSTM+CRF for cQA answer tagging by the paper:

"Incorporating Label Dependency for Answer Quality Tagging in Community Question Answering via CNN-LSTM-CRF".

It is to be appeared in coling 2016.

The experiments are carried on SemEval 2015 task-3 cQA dataset.

  ----ARC-I: 58.96 in F1

  ----ARC-II: 58.29 in F1
  
The systems can be easily implemented with the help of https://github.com/glample/tagger and the parameter settings described in the coling paper.

Any work compared with this paper, please cite when the paper published (late Novemeber, 2016).
